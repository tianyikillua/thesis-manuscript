\section{Crack Nucleation in a Bar under Impact} \label{sec:1d}
Objective: initiaiton is governed by the stress criterion $2\psi_0^+=w_1$.

This problem is analytically solved by supposing an elastic strain softening behavior \cite{Bazant:1985aa} which predicts vanishing energy dissipation at fracture and spurious mesh dependency for finite element solutions. The bar is occupies the interval $\Omega=[0,L]$ and is subject at both ends a tensile shock $vt$ where $v$ measures the intensity. For $t\leq L/c$ before the waves travel the whole length, the analytical solution for the elastic problem can be given by
\begin{align}
u &= -v\inp{t-\frac{x+L}{c}}+v\inp{t+\frac{x-L}{c}}\,, \\
\varepsilon &= \frac{v}{c}\mH\left(t-\frac{x+L}{c}\right)+\frac{v}{c}\mH\left(t+\frac{x-L}{c}\right) \label{eq:epselas}
\end{align}
where $\inp{x}=(\abs{x}+x)/2$ and $\mH$ denotes the Heaviside step function.

\end{figure}

With strain-softening, the analytical solution becomes for $x<0$
\begin{align}
u &= -v\inp{t-\frac{x+L}{c}}-v\inp{t-\frac{L-x}{c}}\,, \\
\varepsilon &= \frac{v}{c}\mH\left(t-\frac{x+L}{c}\right)-\frac{v}{c}\mH\left(t-\frac{L-x}{c}\right). \label{eq:epselas}
\end{align}
At $t=\frac{L}{2c}$, the displacement develops a discontinuity at $x=\frac{L}{2}$ of magnitude $4v\inp{t-\frac{L}{2c}}$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{eps3d.pdf}
\caption{Local strain-softening problem}
\end{figure}

The Lagragian density is given by
\[
\mathcal{L}(u,\dot{u},\alpha)=\int_\Omega\frac{1}{2}a(\alpha)Eu'^2+w_1\bigl(w(\alpha)+\ell\alpha'^2\bigr)-\frac{1}{2}\rho\dot{u}^2.
\]
Scaling the displacement by a factor of $u_0=L\sqrt{w_1/E}$ and using the bar length $L$ and the time for the elastic wave to travel the whole length $L/c$ to normalize the spatial and temporal scales
\begin{align}
u(x,t) &= u_0\uhat\left(\frac{x}{L},\frac{ct}{L}\right)=\uhat(\xhat,\that) \label{eq:u} \\
\alpha(x) &= \ahat\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)=\ahat(\xhat)
\end{align}
we obtain the following adimensional Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\widehat{\mathcal{L}}(\uhat,\dot{\uhat},\ahat)=w_1L\int_0^1\frac{1}{2}a(\ahat)\uhat'^2+w(\ahat)+\widehat{\ell}\ahat'^2-\frac{1}{2}\dot{\uhat}^2
\end{equation}
where the length scale $\widehat{\ell}=\ell/L$ is the only adimensional parameter influencing the qualitative behaviors of the problem. Adopting the AT1 damage constitutive law, the scaling factor $u_0$ is nothing but the critical displacement at which the damage criterion is attained everywhere inside bar for a quasi-static calculation.

For an 1-d elastodynamic problem with uniform spatial mesh, superconvergence can be obtained by using the central difference explicit Newmark scheme $\beta=0$ matched with a lumped mass matrix and the critical time step $\Delta t=h/c$ \cite{Hughes:2010}. In this case the obtained results are exact (with respect to the original time-space continuous problem) at discretization nodes independently of how few elements are used. This property can be illustrated numerically by considering the above elastic bar but without damage mechanism subject to $U(t)=\frac{1}{2}(1-\cos(\pi t))$. If a velocity shock is applied $U(t)=kt$, since the analytical solution is piecewise linear, the numerical one coincides exactly with the theoretic one.

At $t=1$, with $v=0.6$ and $\widehat{\ell}=0.1$, we get

The error for $u$ and $\alpha$ is calculated using the $L^2$ norm
\[
e_u=\frac{\norm{u-u_\mathrm{ref}}_{L_2}}{\norm{u_\mathrm{ref}}_{L_2}}=\frac{\sqrt{\int_\Omega(u-u_\mathrm{ref})^2}}{\sqrt{\int_\Omega u_\mathrm{ref}^2}}.
\]
As for the surface energy $\mathcal{S}$, the error is classically defined by $e_\mathcal{S}=\abs{(\mathcal{S}-\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{ref})/\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{ref}}$. The reference solution is obtained with $h=\widehat{\ell}/100$. The numerical convergence of $(u,\alpha)$ and hence of $\mathcal{S}$ demonstrates the well-posedness of the physical problem thanks to the introduction of a length scale. The superconvergence property is lost, since it can be observed that solutions with different discretization sizes no longer agree with the exact one at nodes. However the quadratic convergence rate remains. It can be observed that $h=\widehat{\ell}/10$ gives sufficiently accurate results and hence will be used in all subsequent calculations.

\caption{Numerical convergence study for $\ell=0.1$: (a) displacement at $t=1$ and (b) convergence rates}
\end{figure}

For the shock velocity $v\in(0.5, 1)$, the bar will solely break at the center where the two tensile waves transmitted from both ends encounter.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{alpha.pdf}
\caption{The final (when $\sup_\Omega\alpha>0.99$) damage field for $v=0.6$ and $\widehat{\ell}=0.1$.}
\end{figure}

Compared to the quasi-static situation, here more energy is dissipated when the bar breaks since the damage is more spread out than the analytical one. This overdissipation of approximately 30\% seems to be independent of the length ratio $\ell/L$ and the shock velocity. In this non-local gradient damage model, the energy dissipation at fracture is always finite at finite material internal length $\ell$ (which garantees that fracture will produce), contrary to the local strain softening model where no energy is dissipated at all \cite{Bazant:1985aa}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Gc-ell.pdf}
\caption{Dissipated energy when the bar breaks.} \label{fig:Gc-ell}
\end{figure}

The instant of fracture varies depending on the length ration $\ell/L$, which illustrates a size effect non-existent in local strain-softening models. At fixed $\ell$ (a material property), the fracture threshold $t_\mathrm{f}$ can be delayed for shorter bars (\emph{smaller is stronger}). On the other hand, the behavior of longer bars is similar to that of a local model as the bar breaks as soon as the two tensile waves encounter. Comparison between these two models can be analyzed in the limit $\ell/L\to 0$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{tf-ell.pdf}
\caption{Size effect.}
\end{figure}

For very high loading speeds $v>1$ and relatively small size ratio $\ell/L$, another size effect regime can be observed. The time of fracture scales linearly with the length ratio $\ell/L$, and inversely proportional to the loading speed $v$ with an exposant $-1.68$. We have
\[
\widehat{t}_\mathrm{f}\propto\frac{\ell}{L\cdot v^{1.68}}
\]
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{tf-ell2v.pdf}
\caption{Size effect and Velocity effect for $v>1$}
\end{figure}

At $t=0.6$, we vary the length scale $\ell/L$ and compare results obtained with the local model and the gradient damage model.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Asymptotic behavior when $\ell/L\to 0$.}
\end{figure}

A slow convergence can be observed in the $L^2$-norm of the normalized displacement. In the limit $\ell/L\to 0$, the normalized displacement $\widehat{u}$ thus converges to that predictied by the local strain-softening model. The real displacement develops a discontinuity at $x=\frac{1}{2}$ with a jump of magnitude $4vu_0\inp{t-\frac{L}{2c}}$.

\section{Antiplane tearing} \label{sec:antiplane}
In this section we will present and discuss a particular numerical experiment tailored to highlight the properties of the dynamic gradient damage model while focusing on the \emph{initiation} and \emph{propagation} phases of defect evolution. Specifically, we will investigate the fracture mechanics criterion for an existing phase-field crack to \emph{initiate}, and then to \emph{propagate} along a certain path. The thematic subjects covered here are thus summarized in \cref{tab:summanti}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Thematic subjects covered in this section} \label{tab:summanti}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We consider a mode-\RN{3} antiplane tearing of a two dimensional plate $\Omega=(0,L)\times(-H,H)$ subject to a hard device $\vec{U}_t=\operatorname{sgn}(y)kt\,\vec{e}_3$ on its left border $x=0$, see Fig. \ref{fig:antiplane}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{antiplane.pdf}
\caption{Mode III antiplane tearing of a two dimensional plate $\Omega=(0,L)\times(-H,H)$ with a loading speed parametrized by $k$. An initial crack $[0,l_0]\times\set{0}$ is present in the domain. The crack is enforced to propagate along the constant direction $\vec{e}_1$.} \label{fig:antiplane}
\end{figure}
An initial damage field corresponding to an preexisting crack $\Gamma_0=\set{\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^2|\alpha_0(\vec{x})=1}=[0,l_0]\times\set{0}$ is present in the domain. For that we prescribe naturally $\dvec^{-1}=1$ on $\Gamma_0$. The loading velocity $k$ will be varied and its effect on the crack propagation speed will be studied. With a modification of the damage dependence of the elastic energy $\mathcal{E}(\vec{u}_t,\alpha_t)$ proposed in \cite{Bourdin:2011}, the crack tip $t\mapsto\vec{P}_t$ is enforced to propagate along the constant direction $\vec{e}_1$, which prohibits consequently crack kinking or branching. Denoting $u$ as the out-of-plane displacement, the elastic energy density in this particular situation reads
\begin{equation} \label{eq:straightmode3}
\psi(\nabla u_t,\alpha_t)=\frac{1}{2}\mu\left(a(\alpha_t)\left(\frac{\partial u_t}{\partial x_2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial u_t}{\partial x_1}\right)^2\right).
\end{equation}
where damage acts only on the $\partial_2 u$ component of the displacement gradient. We assume that this modification \eqref{eq:straightmode3} can be regarded as a particular case of the original model \eqref{eq:elastic} when the crack actually propagates along a specific path without kinking or branching. It allows us to focus on the crack propagation stage.

This problem is initially raised in \cite{Bourdin:2011}. In their model the crack surface energy is approximated by the Ambrosio and Tortorelli elliptic regularization $w(\alpha)=\alpha^2$, whereas here the damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1} is used. The objective is to compare the crack evolution obtained in the dynamic gradient damage model with that predicted by Griffith's law which determines initiation and propagation of cracks. Two experiments will be considered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the first case, the fracture toughness $\gc$ is assumed to be homogeneous throughout the domain. The loading speed is of the same order of the material sound speed $c=\sqrt{\mu/\rho}$ and we will use the explicit Newmark time-stepping method.
\item In the second case, $\gc$ may admit a spatial discontinuity in the propagation direction. We also prescribe a relatively small loading speed in order to investigate the quasi-static limit of the dynamic model. Depending on whether the crack propagation speed itself is smaller with respect to the sound speed or not (the term \emph{unstable} propagation often refers to this case), the implicit or the explicit Newmark method will be used.
\end{enumerate}

A structured crossed triangular mesh with a uniform discretization spacing $\Delta x=\Delta y=h$ is generated and the parameters adopted for all subsequent calculations are summarized in Tab. \ref{tab:paraanti}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Geometric, material and numerical parameters for the antiplane tearing experiment.} \label{tab:paraanti}
\begin{tabular}{lllllllll} \toprule
$L$ & $H$ & $l_0$ & $\mu$ & $\rho$ & $\gc$ & $\ell$ & $h$ & $\Delta t$\\ \midrule
5 & 1 & 1 & 0.2 & 1 & 0.01 & 0.05 & 0.01 & $\Delta t_\mathrm{CFL}$ \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
A typical damage field obtained in this simulation is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:antiplane_2d_new}, where the damage varies from 0 (blue zones) to 1 (red zones). Thanks to the $\Gamma$-convergence theory in the Variational Approach to Fracture, the current crack length $l_t$ can be approximately derived from the damage dissipation energy
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ltapprox}
\mathcal{S}\bigl(\alpha_t\bigr)\approx(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}\,l_t
\end{equation}
with $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}=\bigl(1+3h/(8\ell)\bigr)\gc$ the numerical amplified fracture toughness due to spatial discretization, see \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008,HossainHsuehBourdinBhattachary:2014}. This is the value that a phase-field crack actually dissipates per unit extension in the gradient damage model. The crack speed can thus be obtained by a linear regression analysis during the steady propagation phase. In the case where $\gc$ admits a spatial discontinuity, the current crack tip $\vec{P}_t=(l_t,0)$ is located on the contour $\alpha=0.5$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Homogeneous fracture toughness case} \label{sec:homo}
In the first case a homogeneous plate will be considered. This antiplane tearing example is physically similar to the 1-d film peeling problem which can be studied using the classical Griffith's theory of dynamic fracture. According to \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008} and \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008}, the crack speed, with respect to the loading displacement $U=kt$ or to the physical time $t$, as a function of the loading velocity $k$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dumouchel}
\frac{\mathrm{d} l}{\mathrm{d} U}(k)=\sqrt{\frac{\mu H}{\gc+\rho Hk^2}}\quad\text{or}\quad\frac{\mathrm{d} l}{\mathrm{d} t}(k)=\sqrt{\frac{\mu Hk^2}{\gc+\rho Hk^2}}
\end{equation}
from which we retrieve the quasi-static limit $\mathrm{d} l/\mathrm{d} U(0)=\sqrt{\mu H/\gc}$ announced in \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008} and the dynamic limit as the shearing wave speed $\mathrm{d} l/\mathrm{d} t(\infty)=\sqrt{\mu/\rho}$, classical result of the Griffith's theory of dynamic fracture \cite{Freund:1990}. We also observe that for low loading speeds $k\approx 0$, the dynamic crack speed $\mathrm{d} l/\mathrm{d} t\approx k\sqrt{\mu H/\gc}$ scales linearly in $k$, which agrees with the remarks given in \cite{Bourdin:2011}. The current crack tip $\vec{P}_t$ is numerically located by using the approximation \eqref{eq:ltapprox}. Comparisons between the numerical results using the dynamic gradient model and this theoretic result \eqref{eq:dumouchel} with $\gc$ replaced by $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$ are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:mode3}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{crack_speed.pdf}
\caption{Crack speeds as a function of the loading velocity. The crack speed respect to $t$ is indicated in (a), while in (b) the crack speed with respect to $U$ is used. Comparison with the 1-d analytical solution \eqref{eq:dumouchel} based on the Griffith's criterion.} \label{fig:mode3}
\end{figure}
Despite the transverse wave reflection present in the two-dimensional numerical model, a very good quantitative agreement is found between them. In particular, as it is also observed in \cite{Bourdin:2011}, the numerically obtained crack speed indeed approaches the limiting shear wave speed when the loading speed increases. The explicit Algorithm \ref{algo:explicit} as well as its implementation work fine even at supersonic loading speeds.

The conventional dynamic energy release rate \eqref{eq:GtC} is numerically computed and the validity of the asymptotic Griffith's law is analyzed by varying the inner radius $r$ of virtual perturbations defined in Fig. \ref{fig:theta}. During the propagation phase $\dot{l}_t>0$, three arbitrary time instants are taken when the crack length attains respectively $l_t\approx 1.6$, $l_t\approx 2$ and $l_t\approx 2.4$. An evident $r$-dependence of $G^\alpha_t$ is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:indvelocity}, where the ratio $R/r=\frac{5}{2}$ is fixed.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Gtheta_of_r.pdf}
\caption{Conventional dynamic energy release rate $G^\alpha$ as a function of the inner radius $r$ of the virtual perturbation $\vtheta_t$. Three arbitrary instants when the crack propagates $\dot{l}_t>0$ are chosen.} \label{fig:indvelocity}
\end{figure}
In LEFM in absence of body forces, it is known that the $J$-integral is path-invariant since it is related directly to the dynamic stress intensity factors at the crack tip. In gradient damage models however, there is no more stress singularities. When $r$ is small, we go directly into the process zone dominated by damage-induced strain softening and $G^\alpha_t\to 0$ is expected as $r\to 0$ However, as $r$ increases, $G^\alpha_t$ captures well the outer mechanical fields. An equivalent energy release rate can thus be defined, and according to the asymptotic behaviors of $\gamma_t$, we have the desired result $G^\alpha_t=\gamma_t\to (\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$.

We will then turn to the evolution of the conventional dynamic energy release rate when the existing crack initiates and further propagates. From the above $r$-dependence analysis, a fixed inner radius $r=2\ell$ is used which should already correctly captures the far mechanical fields. The crack length $l_t$ given by \eqref{eq:ltapprox} as well as the calculated $G^\alpha_t$ are given as a function of the loading displacement in Fig. \ref{fig:evoGtGc}, where three separate calculations corresponding to three loading speeds $k$ are reported.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{dyn_Gtheta_k.pdf}
\caption{Conventional dynamic energy release rate $G^\alpha$ as a function of the loading displacement. Three loading speeds $k$ are used.} \label{fig:evoGtGc}
\end{figure}
Recall that an initial crack of length 1 is present in the body and we observe $G^\alpha_t=0$ before the waves arrive at the initial crack tip. When the energy release rate $G^\alpha_t$ at the initial crack tip attains the fracture toughness $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$, the existing crack initiates and starts to propagate with the equality $G^\alpha_t=(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$. We may conclude that the crack-tip evolution (initiation and propagation) is well governed by the asymptotic Griffith's law \eqref{eq:Gasym} in the dynamic gradient damage model, when outer fields are considered.

The internal length $\ell$ plays a rather subtle role during the propagation phase. The crack tip is governed by the asymptotic Griffith's law \eqref{eq:Gasym} if and only if a separation of scales between the inner damage problem and the outer LEFM is possible, \emph{i.e.} only when the internal length is sufficiently small compared to any other structural length \cite{SicsicMarigo:2013}. Although $\ell$ is indeed hidden in \eqref{eq:Gasym}, the validity of the latter depends directly on it. Below we present the simulation results with a fixed loading speed $k=0.2$ and three small enough internal lengths. As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:evoGtGcell}, the crack evolution is globally conforming with Griffith's law, as long as the involved quantities are calculated with a virtual perturbation $\vtheta_t$ capturing correctly the far fields. Here according to Fig. \ref{fig:indvelocity}, we use an inner radius adapted with the internal length $r=2\ell$, which should produce an error less than $3\%$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{dyn_Gtheta_ell.pdf}
\caption{Crack evolution as a function of the loading displacement. Three small enough internal lengths are used.} \label{fig:evoGtGcell}
\end{figure}

The stress distribution along a vertical slice $\set{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2|x=l_t}$ passing by the current crack tip $\vec{P}_t$ should illustrate and highlight the separation of scales when $\ell$ is small. For the sake of simplicity, we consider a stationary crack $[0,2]\times\set{0}$ and solve the static problem with the gradient damage model and the LEFM model. We can verify from Fig. \ref{fig:stress} that the LEFM develops a well-known inverse square root singularities for the two stress components $\sigma_{13}$ and $\sigma_{23}$ and their near-tip fields are well approximated by the theoretic asymptotic solutions.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{asymptotic-sig.pdf}
\caption{Stress distribution along a vertical slice $\set{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2|x=l_t}$ passing by the current crack tip $\vec{P}_t$. The $\sigma_{13}$ (a) and the $\sigma_{23}$ (b) components are indicated. The gradient damage model and the LEFM model are compared.} \label{fig:stress}
\end{figure}
On the other hands, the gradient damage model provides a better modeling of the stress fields near the crack tip as their values are bounded. A good matching can be observed far from the crack tip and the discrepancy with the outer LEFM model is concentrated within a process zone proportionally dependent on the internal length. When $\ell$ is very large, the process zone could cover the whole structural domain and a separation of scales is no longer possible. In this case the asymptotic Griffith's law \eqref{eq:Gasym} is not applicable since we are no longer dealing with a fracture mechanics problem.

\subsection{Discontinuous fracture toughness cases}
As another illustration of the Griffith-conforming crack evolution obtained with the dynamic gradient damage model, we consider the quasi-static limits of the model in presence of a possible fracture toughness discontinuity in the previous plate
\[
\gc=\begin{cases}
\Gamma_1 & x\leq x_0 \\
\Gamma_2 & x>x_0
\end{cases}
\]
with $\Gamma_1<\Gamma_2$ the hardening case and $\Gamma_1>\Gamma_2$ the softening case. A preexisting crack is always present and is introduced via an initial damage field. According to \cite{Versieux:2015}, when the loading speed $k$ is decreased the dynamic gradient damage model converges to the following first-order quasi-static gradient damage evolution model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Irreversibility}: the damage $t\mapsto\alpha_t$ is a non-decreasing function of time.
\item \textbf{First-order stability}: the first-order variation of the potential energy is non-negative with respect to arbitrary admissible displacement and damage fields
\begin{equation} \label{eq:viqs}
\mathcal{P}'(\vec{u}_t,\alpha_t)(\vec{v}_t-\vec{u}_t,\beta_t-\alpha_t)\geq 0\text{ for all $\vec{v}_t\in\mathcal{C}_t$ and all $\beta_t\in\mathcal{D}(\alpha_t)$}.
\end{equation}
where in absence of external forces the potential energy is given by 
\[
\mathcal{P}(\vec{u}_t,\alpha_t)=\mathcal{E}(\vec{u}_t,\alpha_t)+\mathcal{S}(\alpha_t)
\]
\item \textbf{Energy balance}: the only energy dissipation is due to damage
\begin{equation} \label{eq:qsgdeb}
\mathcal{P}_t=\mathcal{P}_0+\int_0^t\left(\int_\Omega\sig_s\cdot\eps(\dot{\vec{U}}_s)\dx\right)\D{s}.
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
In addition, the proof of convergence is made under the hypothesis that the crack evolution $t\mapsto l_t$ is at least continuous in time (as in the classical Griffith theory). Numerically, it is the first-order stability condition \eqref{eq:viqs} that is effectively implemented by the alternate minimization procedure \cite{PhamAmorMarigoMaurini:2011} while the energy balance condition \eqref{eq:qsgdeb} can only be at best checked \emph{a posteriori}.

The homogeneous antiplane tearing problem is firstly solved by the dynamic gradient damage model and the above first-order quasi-static gradient damage model. In the dynamic calculation a small loading speed $k=0.001\approx 0.2\%c$ is assumed and we use the unconditionally stable implicit Newmark scheme as described in Algorithm \ref{algo:implicit}, with $\beta=\frac{1}{4}$. The time step is set to $\Delta t=10\Delta t_\mathrm{CFL}$. In Fig. \ref{fig:homoGcqs} we plot the crack length evolution as well as the conventional energy release rate $G^\alpha_t$ both for the dynamic model and the first-order quasi-static model.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{dyn_qs.pdf}
\caption{Crack length and conventional energy release rate $G^\alpha$ for the homogeneous fracture toughness plate at a very slow loading speed. Comparison between the dynamic model and the first-order quasi-static model.} \label{fig:homoGcqs}
\end{figure}
It is recalled that the static $G^\alpha_t$ can be simply obtained by setting $\dot{\vec{u}}_t$ and $\ddot{\vec{u}}_t$ to zero in \eqref{eq:GtC}. We observe that these two solutions coincide, and both present a time-continuous crack evolution (initiation and propagation) conforming to the asymptotic Griffith's law \eqref{eq:Gasym}. The numerically computed quasi-static crack speed (with respect to $U=kt$) is compared in Tab. \ref{tab:compqsv} to the analytical value $\sqrt{\mu H/\gc}$ announced in \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008}. A very good agreement can be found if the numerically amplified fracture toughness $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$ is used in the formula.
\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Comparison of the numerically computed quasi-static crack speed in the homogeneous case with the theoretic one $\sqrt{\mu H/\gc}$ given in \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008}.} \label{tab:compqsv}
\begin{tabular}{lllll} \toprule
& Numerical & Theoretic & Error \\ \midrule
Quasi-static crack speed & 4.326 & 4.391 & 1.5\% \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We then turn to the hardening case where the fracture toughness jumps suddenly from a lower value $\Gamma_1=0.01$ to a higher one $\Gamma_2=2\Gamma_1=0.02$ at $x=2$. The unconditionally stable implicit Newmark scheme with $\beta=\frac{1}{4}$ is used again with a time increment $\Delta t=10\Delta t_\mathrm{CFL}$. As can be observed from Fig. \ref{fig:hardGcqs} the convergence of the dynamic model toward the quasi-static one is verified and the crack initiates and propagates following Griffith's law. A temporary arrest phase is present shortly after the crack reaches the hardening interface at $x=2$. Due to continuous loading the energy release rate increases and the crack then restarts and begins to propagate in the second material when the energy release rate $G^\alpha_t$ attains the stiffer fracture toughness $\Gamma_2$.

\end{figure}

However for the toughness-softening case where the material toughness $\Gamma_1=2\Gamma_2=0.02$ suddenly drops to a smaller value $\Gamma_2=0.01$ at $x=1$ (exceptionally here the initial crack length is $\frac{1}{4}$), a relatively good matching can only be found before and after the jump phase produced at the discontinuity, both in terms of the crack length evolution and the energy release rate. It is exactly at the jump phase that these two models strongly disagree, cf. Fig. \ref{eq:ressoftening}.

\end{figure}
Here due to the unstable crack propagation during the jump, the explicit Newmark scheme is used for the dynamic calculation with $\Delta t=\Delta t_\mathrm{CFL}$. When the crack arrives at the discontinuity, the \emph{first-order} quasi-static \emph{numerical} model underestimates the crack jump and predicts no further crack arrest, by relating directly the static energy release rate $G^\alpha_t$ to the fracture toughness $\Gamma_2$ just after the jump. For the dynamic model, the jump length is bigger and a subsequent temporary crack arrest is observed, as the dynamic energy release rate oscillates with a high frequency but remains smaller than the fracture toughness $\Gamma_2$ after the jump. We observe that in both cases the jump takes place at $x\approx 0.9$ somewhat prior to the fracture toughness discontinuity $x=1$. We suspect that this is due to the damage regularization of cracks with a half-band $D=2\ell=0.1$ using the constitutive laws of \eqref{eq:at1}. If this effect is ignored, the crack length after the jump is recorded in Tab. \ref{tab:compljump} for each case. From the static energy release rate evolution, we see that the crack length $l_\mathrm{m}$ after the jump predicted in the \emph{first-order} quasi-static \emph{numerical} model is governed by $G(l_\mathrm{m})=\gc(l_\mathrm{m})$ from which authors of \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008} find $l_\mathrm{m}=\sqrt{\Gamma_1/\Gamma_2}=\sqrt{2}$. However their full dynamic analysis shows that the crack length after the jump $l_\mathrm{c}$ should instead be given by the total (quasi-static) energy conservation principle $\mathcal{P}(1)=\mathcal{P}(l_\mathrm{c})$, which results in $l_\mathrm{c}=\Gamma_1/\Gamma_2=2$. We see from Tab. \ref{tab:compljump} that our dynamic gradient damage model indeed reproduces this correct value.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To better analyze the jump phase, energy evolutions are investigated against the crack length in Fig. \ref{fig:evoRNJjump}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{dynqsET_softening.pdf}
\caption{Energy variation as a function of the crack length for the softening fracture toughness plate at a very slow loading speed. Comparison between the dynamic model and the first-order quasi-static model.} \label{fig:evoRNJjump}
\end{figure}
In the quasi-static case we pick the total energy $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}+\mathcal{S}$ while in the dynamic case we plot separately the static energy $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}+\mathcal{S}$ and the kinetic one $\mathcal{K}$. Before and sufficiently after the jump a good agreement between these two potential energies can be found. We observe that the (incorrect) quasi-static jump (\emph{i.e.}, an \emph{unstable} or \emph{brutal} crack propagation) is accompanied by a slight loss of the total energy $\Delta \mathcal{P}_\mathrm{stat.}$, contradicting the balance condition \eqref{eq:qsgdeb}. This phenomenon has already been observed by several authors such as \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008,AmorMarigoMaurini:2009,PhamAmorMarigoMaurini:2011,Bourdin:2011}. On the one hand, it can be regarded as a numerical issue as the effective implementation of the quasi-static model is solely based on the first-order stability condition \eqref{eq:viqs}. For this particular problem based on quasi-static energy conservation we could predict a correct quasi-static crack evolution toward which the dynamic solution converges when the loading speed becomes small, see \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008}. On the other hand, from a theoretic point of view, it is already known in \cite{Pham:2010} that there may not exist an energy-conserving evolution which also respects the stability criterion at every time. Moreover even equipped with the energy balance condition, the quasi-static model may still differ from the dynamic analysis \cite{LazzaroniBargelliniDumouchelMarigo:2012}. A natural and physical remedy for all general unstable crack propagation cases is to introduce inertial effects. In Fig. \ref{fig:evoRNJjump} the dynamic jump process is \emph{continuous} (the crack propagates at a finite speed bounded by the shear wave speed) compared to the quasi-static one where the jump occurs necessarily in a discontinuous fashion between two iterations. We verify the conclusions drawn in \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008} that the kinetic energy $\mathcal{K}$ plays only a transient role in this problem, as it attains a finite value during the jump and becomes again negligible after. The dynamic potential energy $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}+\mathcal{S}$ after the jump is slightly bigger that its value before the jump, due to the fact that the loading speed $k=0.001$ is small but not zero.

During the jump, the crack propagates at a speed comparable to the material sound speed which, according to \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008}, is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:vjump}
v_\mathrm{jump}=\frac{\left(\sqrt{\gamma_1+\epsilon^2}+\epsilon\right)^2-\gamma_2}{\left(\sqrt{\gamma_1+\epsilon^2}+\epsilon\right)^2+\gamma_2}\cdot c
\end{equation}
with the adimensional fracture toughness $\gamma_i=\Gamma_i/(2\mu H)$ and the normalized loading speed $\epsilon=k/c$. The crack length evolution during the jump is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:softGcqs_jump}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{jump.pdf}
\caption{Zoom in time at the crack length jump due to sudden toughness softening for the dynamic model.} \label{fig:softGcqs_jump}
\end{figure}
Due to transverse wave reflection in this 2-d problem, the crack propagates during this interval with a small fluctuation of period $T$ approximately corresponding to the first standing wave between the boundary and the crack $T\approx 2H/c\approx 4.5$. That's why we calculate from Fig. \ref{fig:softGcqs_jump} only the initial crack speed at jump for comparison in Tab. \ref{tab:compjumpv}. A good agreement can be found between the numerical and the theoretic ones.

\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper further physical insights into the dynamic gradient damage model are provided via a simple antiplane tearing experiment. As a phase-field approach to brittle fracture, it can indeed be regarded as a generalization or a superset of the LEFM theory, since the crack evolution is shown to be Griffith-conforming in several situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the dynamic tearing example of a homogeneous plate, it is verified that the crack evolution is governed by the asymptotic Griffith's law \eqref{eq:Gasym}, as long as the material internal length is sufficiently small to establish a separation of scales between the inner damage problem and the outer LEFM problem. The conventional dynamic energy release rate is numerically computed and verified as a tool to translate gradient damage mechanics results in fracture mechanics terminology. We conduct a comparison with the 1-d peeling problem \cite{DumouchelMarigoCharlotte:2008} analytically studied with the classical Griffith's theory of dynamic fracture. A good agreement between them can be found in terms of the crack speeds prediction as a function of the loading speed.

\item We then investigate the quasi-static limits of the dynamic gradient damage model. In absence of \emph{brutal} or \emph{unstable} crack propagation where the classical static Griffith's theory fails, the dynamic model converges to the first-order quasi-static gradient damage model, when the loading speed decreases. However when the crack may propagate at a speed comparable to the material sound speed, the dynamic model should be preferred to correctly account for inertial effects. The crack evolution in the dynamic gradient damage model is in quantitative accordance with the LEFM predictions on the 1-d peeling problem.
\end{itemize}

These numerical experiments provide hence a justification of the dynamic gradient damage model along with its current implementation, when it is used as a phase-field model for complex real-world dynamic fracture problems. Furthermore, the gradient damage model could also be used as a tool to explore and explain numerous dynamic fracture phenomena. Our future work will be devoted to this point.

\section{Kinking} \label{sec:kinking}
The stability condition \eqref{eq:vi} determines when and how the crack propagates. In particular, it should be able to predict the spatial and temporel crack path which may present some discontinuities due to the quasi-static assumption \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008,ChambolleFrancfortMarigo:2009}. We will investigate in this subsection how the crack kinks under mixed loading and compare the apparent kinking angle with some theoretic criteria commonly used in fracture mechanics to supplement the Griffith's law.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{kinking_pb.pdf}
\end{figure}

The problem setting is adapted from \cite{HakimKarma:2005,HakimKarma:2009}. A hard device $\vec{U}$ is imposed on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ of an unit squared domain $\Omega=(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})\times (-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ containing an initial straight crack $\Gamma_t=(-\frac{1}{2},0)$ modelled by a Dirichlet condition of damage $\alpha=1$ on $\Gamma_t$. Similar to the crack propagation simulation, the imposed displacement is nothing but the asymptotic expansion of the displacement field near the crack tip $\vec{P}_0=(0,0)$ with the opening and sliding intensity factors $K_1>0$ and $K_2\geq 0$. The problem is again posed under plane stress condition and by virtue of Irwin's formula the imposed energy release rate is given by
\[
\overline{G}=\frac{K_1^2+K_2^2}{E}.
\]
To ensure that the crack will indeed propagate under this particular loading, this value should be slightly larger than the material toughness $G_0>\gc$.

Typical simulation results are illustrated by the damage field calculated with alternate minimization.

\end{figure}

Some conclusions
\begin{itemize}
\item Influence of the internal length?
\item Numerical kinking angles are in the range of theoretic predictions, as long as the internal length is sufficiently small (same remark as for the propagation example)
\item Neither of the kinking criterions seems to be favoured by the meta-stability condition, however bear in mind that structural effect and angle measuring from the damage field may contribute to the discrepancies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamic Crack Branching} \label{sec:branching}
We will first study the dynamic crack branching problem for a 2-d plane stress plate under constant pressure applied on its upper and lower boundaries. This particular problem has already been investigated within the phase-field community \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,SchlueterWillenbuecherKuhnMueller:2014} where the numerical convergence aspect as well as the physical insight into the branching mechanism are analyzed. Here we will mainly focus on the computational efficiency as well as the possible use of several damage constitutive laws to approximate fracture.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{plateres.pdf}
\caption{Geometry and loading conditions for the dynamic crack branching problem. Damage field $\alpha_t$ at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ ranging from 0 (gray) to 1 (white).} \label{fig:branching}
\end{figure}

The geometry as well as the loading conditions are depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:branching}. Due to symmetry only the upper half part is modeled. The initial crack $\Gamma_0$ is introduced via an initial damage field $\alpha^{-1}$. Material parameters are borrowed from \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012} where the internal length $\ell$ is set to $\SI{0.25}{mm}$. We use a structured quadrilateral elements of equal discretization spacing $h\approx\SI{0.045}{mm}$ in both directions achieving approximately 1 million elements. The current time increment is calculated based on the CFL condition with a security factor of 0.8. An unstructured mesh should be in general preferred. However the original analysis on mesh-induced anisotropy is conducted on structured triangular elements \cite{Negri:1999}. Furthermore the numerical study of \cite{LorentzGodard:2011} shows that the crack direction is insensitive to the orientation of a structured quadrilateral grids. We firstly use the damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1}. The symmetric tension-compression formulation is also adopted. This choice is justified by an \emph{a posteriori} verification of non-interpenetration of matter. The simulation result is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:branching} by the damage field $\alpha_t$ at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ ranging from 0 (gray) to 1 (white). Similar contours have been obtained in \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,SchlueterWillenbuecherKuhnMueller:2014}.

A strong scaling analysis is conducted for several processor cores $\mathrm{NP}$ in the cluster Aster5 \cite{DelmasLefebvre:2014} provided by the Electricité de France. We have verified that all simulations give nearly the same results in terms of global energy evolution and field contours. The difference of the elastic energy at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ is within 0.2\% between the sequential and the parallel $\mathrm{NP}=16$ cases, which may be due to floating point arithmetic and different setting of preconditioners. The scaling results are given in Fig. \ref{fig:scaling}. The calculation time is partitioned into 4 items: the ``elastodynamics'' part related to the solving of \eqref{eq:waveeqsdis}, the ``damage assembly'' part where the global Hessian matrix $\vec{H}$ and the second member $\vec{b}$ is constructed, the ``damage solving'' part where \eqref{eq:crackstdis} is solved and the ``communication'' part corresponding to the data exchange among processors. The maximum value among all processors are used. Quasi-ideal scaling is observed for the total computational time. The proportion of the ``elastodynamics'' and the ``damage assembly'' parts are decreasing, due to the increase of the ``communication'' overhead reaching 15\% with 16 cores and becoming comparable to that of the ``damage solving''.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plate_scaling.pdf}
\caption{Strong scaling results for the dynamic crack branching problem with 1 million elements.} \label{fig:scaling}
\end{figure}

We remark that the quadratic bound-constrained minimization problem \eqref{eq:crackstdis} solved by the GPCG scheme implemented in PETSc is not very costly and represents in sequential and parallel calculations only 13\% of the total computational time. In the phase-field literature the damage problem is often solved by an unconstrained minimization of \eqref{eq:crackstdis} corresponding to a linear system
\begin{equation} \label{eq:linearsystem}
\vec{H}\dvec=\vec{b}.
\end{equation}
To reinforce irreversibility, either the damage driving term is replaced by a history field \cite{HofackerMiehe:2012,BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012}, or \eqref{eq:linearsystem} is followed by an \emph{a posteriori} projection in the admissible space, see \cite{LancioniRoyer-Carfagni:2009}. However, it should be kept in mind that the above computationally-appealing strategy only applies to the damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2}, where the solution of \eqref{eq:linearsystem} lies necessarily between 0 and 1 and the objective functional $q$ is indeed quadratic with respect to $\dvec$. Otherwise a specific numerical scheme for bound-constrained problems is needed. Nevertheless we would like to point out that the GPCG solver is extremely efficient even compared to the above strategy consisting of only one linear equation. The same crack branching analysis is conducted using the damage constitutive model \eqref{eq:at2} and a same internal length $\ell=\SI{0.25}{mm}$ and the results obtained with the GPCG solver and the above \emph{a posteriori} projection method are compared. In the latter case the same PCG method is employed to solve \eqref{eq:linearsystem}. The results are slightly different as expected, since the projection method does not solve exactly the full minimization problem \eqref{eq:crackstdis}. To compare their relative computational costs, the time consumed in damage solving is separately normalized by that corresponding to the elastodynamic problem in Tab. \ref{tab:gpcg_vs_cg_proj}.
\begin{table}[htbp]

\centering
\caption{Relative damage-solving cost normalized by the time devoted to the elastodynamic part during a parallel calculation $\mathrm{NP}=16$. The damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} is used. Comparison between the GPCG solver and the \emph{a posteriori} projection method.} \label{tab:gpcg_vs_cg_proj}
\begin{tabular}{lll} \toprule
&  CG + projection & GPCG \\ \midrule
Damage-solving cost & 50\% & 77\% \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Opposed to what is suggested by \cite{AmorMarigoMaurini:2009}, the use of a bound-constrained minimization solver implies a relative computational cost only 27\% higher than a traditional linear solver. This can be seen in the normalized histogram of CG iterations per time step illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:histcg}. We recall that each CG iteration implies a matrix-vector multiplication, the most costly part of the algorithm. When only one linear system is to be solved in the \emph{a posteriori} projection method, approximately 20 CG iterations are needed in 35\% of all time steps. When the GPCG solver is used, we observe that the histogram is more spread out and more than 50 CG iterations may be needed for some time steps. Nevertheless the distribution is more concentrated around 10 to 30 iterations.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{hist_cg_tao_vs_cg_proj.pdf}
\caption{Normalized histogram of CG iterations per time step. The damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} is used. Comparison between the GPCG solver and the \emph{a posteriori} projection method.} \label{fig:histcg}
\end{figure}

We then turn to the choice of different damage constitutive laws from a computational and physical point of view. We take the simulation results using \eqref{eq:at1} as a reference and compare it with the widely used damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} in the phase-field modeling of fracture. The quantitative effects of the internal length actually depend on the damage constitutive model used. Here we propose two natural choices of $\ell$ in the \eqref{eq:at2} case: one corresponding to the same value $\ell=\SI{0.25}{mm}$ as used in the \eqref{eq:at1} case, the other corresponding to a same maximal tensile stress as used in the \eqref{eq:at1} case, which gives $\ell\approx\SI{0.07}{mm}$. We recall from \cite{PhamAmorMarigoMaurini:2011} that the maximal stress than can be supported by a gradient damage material is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sigm}
\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\begin{cases}
\sqrt{\frac{3\gc E}{8\ell}} & \text{\eqref{eq:at1} case}, \\
\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{16}\sqrt{\frac{\gc E}{\ell}} & \text{\eqref{eq:at2} case},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
which determines the internal length as long as the material toughness and the Young's modulus are fixed. The same GPCG solver is used and the relative damage-solving costs separately normalized by the time devoted to the elastodynamic part are reported in Tab. \ref{tab:at1_vs_at2}. We remark that the use of the constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1} or a smaller internal length $\ell$ reduces significantly the relative damage-solving cost. A viable explanation is given as follows. The theoretical 1-d damage profile of \eqref{eq:at2} corresponds to an exponential function without a finite support \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008,MieheHofackerWelschinger:2010}. The damage band $2D$, \emph{i.e.} in which $\alpha_t>0$, is much wider than the \eqref{eq:at1} case where $D=2\ell$. Consequently, less \emph{active} nodes are present and the GPCG solver identifies much more \emph{free} nodes for the \eqref{eq:at2} case, which induces a bigger linear system to be solved. Similarly, a reduction of the material internal length may imply finer mesh along the crack path, however the damage is more concentrated and the relative solving cost is decreased.
\begin{table}[htbp]

\centering
\caption{Relative damage-solving cost normalized by the time devoted to the elastodynamic part during a parallel calculation $\mathrm{NP}=16$. The GPCG solver is used. Comparison between different constitutive laws.} \label{tab:at1_vs_at2}
\begin{tabular}{ll} \toprule
& Damage-solving cost  \\ \midrule
\eqref{eq:at1} & 32\% \\
\eqref{eq:at2} with a same $\ell$ & 77\% \\
\eqref{eq:at2} with a same $\sigma_\mathrm{m}$ & 36\% \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The damage field $\alpha_t$ at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ obtained with the constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:at2_ell_sigm}. Recall that the same mesh with $h=\SI{0.05}{mm}$ is used and should be sufficient for both calculations. Compared to Fig. \ref{fig:branching} obtained with \eqref{eq:at1}, the \emph{transition area} where $0<\alpha_t<1$ is more pronounced especially in Fig. \ref{fig:at2_ell_sigm} with $\ell=\SI{0.25}{mm}$, conforming to the above discussions on the damage band. Another reason behind a relatively large zone with intermediate damage values is due to the different stress-strain behavior of these two constitutive laws during a homogeneous traction experiment \cite{PhamAmorMarigoMaurini:2011}. In the \eqref{eq:at1} case the material possesses a purely elastic domain and damage doesn't evolve as long as the maximal stress in \eqref{eq:sigm} is not reached. Then the material follows a classical softening behavior as damage grows from 0 to 1. However for the constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} widely used in phase-field modeling, damage evolves the instant when the material is subjected to external loadings. An elastic domain is absent and stress-hardening is observed within the damage interval $[0,\frac{1}{4}]$, as is already been reported by \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,SchlueterWillenbuecherKuhnMueller:2014}. In this case the phase-field $\alpha_t$ loses its physical interpretation as \emph{damage}, and hence correctly handling and interpreting crack healing is not trivial \cite{SchlueterWillenbuecherKuhnMueller:2014}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3cm]{AT2_ell_sigm.pdf}

\end{figure}

Furthermore, this peculiar behavior of the constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} also contributes to an overestimation of the dissipated energy, as is noted in \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,VignolletMayBorstVerhoosel:2014}. The energy evolution in this dynamic crack branching problem is given in Fig. \ref{fig:energy_at1_at2}. It is observed that the \eqref{eq:at2} law produces a dissipated energy much bigger than the \eqref{eq:at1} case, although according to Fig. \ref{fig:at2_ell_sigm} the damage fields are similar.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{damage_constitutive_laws.pdf}
\caption{Energy evolution for the dynamic crack branching problem obtained with several constitutive laws.} \label{fig:energy_at1_at2}
\end{figure}

As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:at2_ell_sigm} and \ref{fig:energy_at1_at2}, apparently the results obtained with the same internal length $\ell$ resembles better the \eqref{eq:at1} calculation in Fig. \ref{fig:branching}, even though it corresponds to a smaller maximal stress than the latter case. It should be reminded that $\ell$ does not play merely the role of determination of the maximal stress as in \eqref{eq:sigm}. From \cite{SicsicMarigo:2013}, this parameter also contributes qualitatively to the separation of the outer linear elastic fracture mechanics problem and the inner crack tip problem in an asymptotic context. A smaller internal length implies a wider region outside the crack where the fracture mechanics theory may apply. Meanwhile, a size effect is also introduced via this internal length as it influences the stability of a structure \cite{PhamMarigo:2013-1}. We admit that the choice of this parameter is not a simple one and may constitute one of the difficulties in phase-field modeling of fracture problems.

\section{Edge-cracked plate under shearing impact} \label{sec:kalthoff}
We then consider a pre-notched two-dimensional plane strain plate impacted by a projectile. In the dynamic fracture community this is often referred as the Kalthoff-Winkler experiment reported by \emph{e.g.} \cite{Kalthoff:2000} where a failure mode transition from brittle to ductile fracture is observed for a high strength maraging steel when the impact velocity is increased. Due to symmetry, only the upper half part of the plate will be considered. The geometry and the boundary conditions for the reduced problem are described in Fig. \ref{fig:kalthoff}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{kalthoff.pdf}
\caption{Geometry and boundary conditions for the edge-cracked plate under shearing impact problem. Damage field $\alpha_t$ at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ ranging from 0 (gray) to 1 (white).} \label{fig:kalthoff}
\end{figure}
As in \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,HofackerMiehe:2012}, the projectile impact is modeled by a prescribed velocity with an initial rise time of \SI{1e-6}{s} to avoid acceleration shocks. The material parameters are borrowed from \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012} except that the internal length $\ell$ is set to $\SI{0.2}{mm}$. An unstructured and uniform triangular mesh with $h\approx \SI{0.1}{mm}$ is used, arriving at approximately 3 million elements. The current time increment is again calculated based on the CFL condition with a security factor of 0.8. Due to a lower computational cost and a more brittle material behavior, the damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1} is used for this simulation.

As a reference, we use the elastic energy split proposed in \cite{FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010} where the positive semidefinite part of the total strain will contribute to damage. The initial crack is introduced via a real notch in the geometry. A similar strong scaling curve as Fig. \ref{fig:scaling} is obtained with up to 32 cores. Due to the additional spectral decomposition, the ``damage assembly'' phase represents now approximately 50\% of the total computational time while the ``damage solving'' still accounts for only 10\%. The actual computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a $3\times 3$ symmetric matrix is performed by a robust and efficient semi-analytic algorithm described in \cite{Scherzinger:2008aa}. The damage field $\alpha_t$ at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:kalthoff}, obtained with an imposed impact speed $v=\SI{16.5}{m/s}$. The initial and average propagation angles are in good agreement with the experimental results and other phase-field simulations \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,HofackerMiehe:2012} based on the damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at2} and the tension-compression asymmetry formulation proposed by \cite{MieheHofackerWelschinger:2010}.

If the initial crack $\Gamma_0$ is modeled via an initial damage field $\alpha^{-1}$, as for the previous dynamic crack branching example, no crack propagation is observed and the structures behaves as if the crack does not exist, \emph{i.e.} the crack closure phenomenon. The horizontal displacement $u_x$ obtained in both cases at $t\approx\SI{2.4e-5}{s}$ when the real notch case starts to propagate is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:alpha0}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=5.5cm]{alpha0.pdf}
\caption{Displacement $u_x$ ranging from \SI{0}{mm} (blue) to \SI{0.4}{mm} (red) for (a) the real notch induced initial crack and (b) the damage induced initial crack, at $t\approx\SI{2.4e-5}{s}$ when the crack starts to propagate in the real notch case (a).} \label{fig:alpha0}
\end{figure}
In the real notch induced initial crack case, \emph{contact condition is not prescribed} on the initial crack lips distanced by a finite height $\approx h$ in the geometry. As can be checked from Fig. \ref{fig:alpha0}, no material interpenetration happens in the real notch case and waves propagate in the plate through the lower impacted edge. However in the damage induced initial crack case, possible normal compressive stresses can indeed be transferred to the upper part of the plate, via the tension-compression asymmetry model \cite{FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010} which simulates a crack closure. Nevertheless, our simulation illustrates that this model also prohibits tangential relative movement along the crack lips, and a \emph{perfect adhesion} (no-slip condition) is observed, \emph{i.e.} exactly the opposite situation compared to the real notch case. This result is expected from our discussions on future improvement of these tension-compression formulations in Sect. \ref{sec:howtochoose}. The failure of these elastic energy decompositions to account for the actual damage value or its gradient approximating the crack normal has been reported by \cite{MayVignolletBorst:2015}. In the subsequent discussions we will only consider the case where the initial crack is introduced via a real notch in the geometry.

The numerically obtained damage profile on a cross-section in the reference configuration parallel to the crack normal is compared to the theoretical one given by $\alpha(x)=(1-\abs{x}/D)^2$ with $D=2\ell$ in the \eqref{eq:at1} case \cite{PhamAmorMarigoMaurini:2011}. From Fig. \ref{fig:damageprofile}, it can be observed that the numerical damage profile is wider than the analytical prediction by approximately $2h=\SI{0.2}{mm}$. This phenomena leads to the definition of a numerically amplified effective fracture toughness $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}$, see \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008}, which in this example is given by $(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}=\bigl(1+3(2h)/(8\ell)\bigr)\gc$ corresponding to the constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1} adapted from \cite{HossainHsuehBourdinBhattachary:2014}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{kalthoff_alpha.pdf}
\caption{Damage profile perpendicular to the crack.} \label{fig:damageprofile}
\end{figure}

From the $\Gamma$-convergence result \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008} the crack length $l_t$ can be estimated by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ltfroms}
\mathcal{S}(\alpha_t)\approx(\gc)_\mathrm{eff}\cdot l_t.
\end{equation}
A 2nd-order difference scheme is then used to calculate the crack velocity.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Crack length and velocity obtained for the edge-cracked plate with an imposed impact speed $v=\SI{16.5}{m/s}$.} \label{fig:crack_length_speed}
\end{figure}
As can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:crack_length_speed}, the crack speed is well bounded by the Rayleigh wave speed (here $0.7c_\mathrm{R}$), the theoretical limiting speed for an in-plane crack. It should be noted that this upper bound is rooted in the stability condition \eqref{eq:vi} and the energy balance \eqref{eq:dyngdeb}, contrary to the thick level set approach \cite{MoreauMoesPicartStainier:2015} where this limiting speed is considered as an additional modeling parameter. The crack length is approximately \SI{90}{mm} at $t=\SI{8e-5}{s}$ when the crack is about to reach the boundary, cf. Fig. \ref{fig:kalthoff}. This estimation agrees fairly well with a direct calculation based on a straight crack propagating at \SI{64}{\degree}, which gives about \SI{83}{mm}. We believe that the discrepancy on crack length as well as a smaller limiting speed for brittle materials reported in experiments can be attributed to the dynamic instability mechanism reviewed in \cite{FinebergMarder:1999}. As the crack speed approaches a critical speed approximately $0.4c_\mathrm{R}$, micro-branches appear along the main crack and hence more energy is dissipated during propagation. In that case \eqref{eq:ltfroms} is no longer valid and the apparent fracture toughness should be adapted to be velocity-dependent. With the \eqref{eq:at2} constitutive law, authors of \cite{BordenVerhooselScottHughesLandis:2012,VignolletMayBorstVerhoosel:2014} report a systematic overestimation of the damage dissipation energy according to \eqref{eq:ltfroms}. Following our discussion in the previous simulation, we suspect that it is mainly due to the absence of a purely elastic domain and the fact that damage evolves even in the stress-hardening phase. However in the definition of the fracture toughness this phenomena is not taken into account \cite{BourdinFrancfortMarigo:2008}.

When the prescribed impact velocity is increased from $v=\SI{16.5}{m/s}$ to $v=\SI{100}{m/s}$, successive crack branching and nucleation of cracks at the lower-right corner due to high tensile stresses are observed as can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:v1d5}. The hydrostatic stress $p_t=\frac{1}{2}\tr\sig_t$ is presented in the deformed configuration and we verify that no damage is produced in the compression zones. To visualize the crack, elements with $\alpha_t>0.9$ are hidden in the graphical output. Similar phenomena have been reported in \cite{HofackerMiehe:2012} with $v=\SI{50}{m/s}$. Recall that in the Kalthoff-Winkler experiment a failure-mode transition from mode-\RN{1} to mode-\RN{2} is observed when the impact velocity increases. The discrepancy between our simulation and the experiment is due to the material constitutive behavior. As a material parameter, the tension-compression formulation \cite{FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010} coupled with a purely elastic model favors propagation of mode-\RN{1} cracks in the direction perpendicular to the maximal principle stress. On the contrary, the high strength steel used in the experiment develops a considerable plastic zone along the mode-\RN{2} crack and an elastic-plastic-damage model should be more suitable \cite{MieheHofackerSchaenzelAldakheel:2015}. Nevertheless, experimentally more bifurcations are indeed observed for brittle materials such as glass when the impact velocity is increased, which is known as a \emph{velocity effect} in \cite{Schardin:2012}.

The tension-compression asymmetry model \cite{FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010} is used.} \label{fig:v1d5}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the widely used elastic energy density split proposed in \cite{MieheHofackerWelschinger:2010} produces diffusive damage in compression zones. From Fig. \ref{fig:v1d5_miehe}, we observe appearance of damage at the lower-left corner and at the lower surface of the initial crack edge, even though they are both under compression. This phenomena is conforming to our previous theoretical analysis of this model on a homogeneous uniaxial compression experiment in Sect. \ref{sec:uniaxial}, where it is found that damage grows even though the compressive stress is still increasing in its absolute value.

\end{figure}

The tension-compression split based on the trace of the total strain \cite{AmorMarigoMaurini:2009} is also tested. In \cite{LancioniRoyer-Carfagni:2009}, the pure compression version of this model is used to simulate shear cracking behavior in the stone ashlars. In this dynamic impact problem, we also observe at $t\approx\SI{7e-6}{s}$ appearance of mode-\RN{2} cracks originating from the impacted-edge, see Fig. \ref{fig:TC2}. We conclude that the tension-compression split \eqref{eq:elasticTC} could indeed be considered as a material parameter as it represents the fracture mechanism determined by the microstructure. Note however that the calculation suddenly stops after that time due to an extremely small CFL time step $\Delta t_\mathrm{CFL}=h/c$, which is caused by a highly distorted element $h\to 0$ in our updated Lagrangian formulation. The same numerical issue has been reported by \cite{PieroLancioniMarch:2007} in which an Ogen hyperelastic model is used. Remark that the use of a tension-compression split based on the positive eigenvalues of the strain, \emph{i.e.} that of \cite{MieheHofackerWelschinger:2010,FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010}, actually circumvents this problem by revising the material constitutive behavior.

\section{Crack Arrest Due to the Presence of a Hole} \label{sec:gregoire}
The problem considered is the ``one crack two holes'' test studied in \cite{HaboussaGregoireElguedjMaigreCombescure:2011}, where it is found that in dynamics cracks may be pushed away from the holes present in the domain due to wave reflections. The geometry and the boundary conditions are recalled in Fig. \ref{fig:gregoire}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{gregoire.pdf}

\end{figure}
Plane stress condition is assumed. Initial crack is introduced via a real notch in the geometry. The damage constitutive law \eqref{eq:at1} is used again due to its interesting properties discussed in the dynamic crack branching problem. Since PMMA is a brittle material \cite{GregoireMaigreRethoreCombescure:2007} and the model of \cite{MieheHofackerWelschinger:2010} possesses a peculiar behavior under high compression, the tension-compression asymmetry formulation proposed by \cite{FreddiRoyer-Carfagni:2010} is adopted. Materials properties of PMMA, including the density, the dynamic Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio, are borrowed from \cite{HaboussaGregoireElguedjMaigreCombescure:2011}. In their calculations crack propagation is based on a variant of the Griffith's law where one critical stress intensity factor $K_\mathrm{IC}=\SI{1.03}{MPa\sqrt{m}}$ predicts initiation and another $K_\mathrm{IA}=\SI{0.8}{MPa\sqrt{m}}$ determines crack propagation and arrest. The latter one is used in our calculation as it deals with the most important phase of crack evolution. It is then converted to the fracture toughness
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pmmagc}
\gc=\frac{K_\mathrm{IA}^2}{E}\approx\SI{0.2667}{N/mm}
\end{equation}
thanks to the Irwin's formula under plane stress condition. The material internal length, or equivalently the maximal tensile stress of PMMA used in the experiment through \eqref{eq:sigm}, is unknown. Two reasonable values are tested corresponding respectively to a critical stress $\SI{70}{MPa}$ or $\SI{80}{MPa}$, which gives along with \eqref{eq:pmmagc} either $\ell\approx\SI{0.05}{mm}$ or $\ell\approx\SI{0.0375}{mm}$. An unconstrained mixed triangular-quadrilateral mesh refined with $h\approx\SI{2e-2}{mm}$ near the initial crack and all possible nucleation sites is used, arriving at approximately \num{400000} elements. The current time increment is updated based on the CFL condition with a security factor of 0.8.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.7cm]{gregoire_7080.pdf}
\caption{Hydrostatic stress $p_t=\frac{1}{2}\tr\sig_t$ ranging from less than \SI{-30}{MPa} (blue) to more than \SI{30}{MPa} (red) for (a) $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{70}{MPa}$ at $t\approx\SI{1.6e-4}{s}$, and (b) $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{80}{MPa}$ at $t\approx\SI{1.8e-4}{s}$, in the crack arrest problem.} \label{fig:siggregoire}
\end{figure}

The simulations results are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:siggregoire}. In both cases crack arrest is reproduced due to the high compression area under the right circular hole. In the case when the maximal tensile stress is set to $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{70}{MPa}$, secondary crack nucleation is observed at the right circular hole boundary under high tension. This phenomena is not observed in experiments and hence the critical stress value of $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{70}{MPa}$ is thus underestimated. In the $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{80}{MPa}$ case, no secondary crack nucleation is found. This result again highlights the role played by the internal length $\ell$ as a material parameter.

\caption{Crack tip abscissa evolution in the crack arrest problem. Comparison between the $\sigma_\mathrm{m}=\SI{80}{MPa}$ case and the experimental results.} \label{fig:cracktip}
\end{figure}

As the crack front is not explicitly tracked in phase-field modeling of fracture, here the current crack tip is located on the contour $\alpha=0.9$ at the farthest point in the $x$-direction. We then compare the numerical crack tip abscissa evolution with the experimental one \cite{HaboussaGregoireElguedjMaigreCombescure:2011}, in Fig. \ref{fig:cracktip}. Very good agreement can be found in the crack initiation and propagation phase. The crack arrest predicted is slightly conservative compared to the experimental one. This could be due to the small deviation of the initial crack from the symmetry axis in the experiment \cite{HaboussaGregoireElguedjMaigreCombescure:2011}. Meanwhile the maximal tensile stress $\sigma_\mathrm{m}\geq\SI{80}{MPa}$ could be considered as an adjusting parameter of the model. More simulations could be performed to determine its best value, at a price of using a more refined mesh since $\ell\propto1/\sigma_\mathrm{m}^2$ according to \eqref{eq:sigm}.

\section{Brazilian Test} \label{sec:brazilian}

\section{Dynamic Fracture of L-Shaped Concrete Specimen} \label{sec:L-specimen}
This dynamic tensile test on a L-shaped concrete specimen is proposed in \cite{OzboltBedeSharmaMayer:2015}. Its geometry and loading conditions are summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:L-specimen}. A hard device (displacement control) is applied on the lower left arm \SI{30}{mm} from the edge through a disc of $D=\SI{45}{mm}$ to suppress if possible local damages due to concentration. A quadrilateral mesh refined near \emph{a priori} known crack propagation region is used, arriving at approximately quadrilateral \num{200000} elements. The concrete material properties (density, elastic moduli and fracture toughness) are taken from \cite{OzboltBedeSharmaMayer:2015}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{L-specimen.pdf}

\end{figure}

The load is applied through unilateral contact (EPX keyword \texttt{IMPACT}) with a hard device with imposed velocity $\vec{V}(t)=\overline{V}f(t)\vec{e}_2$. The intensity is scaled via the factor $\overline{V}$. The function $f(t)$ defined below ensures that at crack initiation the loading velocity is approximately $V$. Three loading speeds are tested: $\SI{0.74}{m/s}$, $\SI{1}{m/s}$ and $\SI{1.5}{m/s}$. From Figs. \ref{fig:L-specimen} and \ref{fig:alpha_L}, we observe that the initial propagation angle slightly increases with the prescribed velocity (see also Tab. \ref{tab:initial_angle}) and crack branching may produce, as it is also reported in experiments.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We then turn to the global dynamic structural response obtained with different loading rates. As it is expected, the peak load increases with the prescribed velocity, cf. Fig. \ref{fig:F-t-L-sim}. A good agreement with the experimental measurement is also found at $v=\SI{1.5}{m/s}$ as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:F-t-L}. Knowing that no strain rates effects is taken into account during material constitutive modeling, this increase of peak load for higher loading rates can be attributed to inertial itself. According to \cite{OzboltBedeSharmaMayer:2015}, this progressive increase of resistance is a pure consequence of inertial effects and not from velocity-dependent material strength or fracture energy.

\end{figure}

It should be noted that these calculations have been performed with a relatively small internal length $\ell=\SI{1}{mm}$, which amounts to overestimate the tensile strength $\sigma_\mathrm{max}\approx \SI{27}{MPa}$ of the concrete. If we use instead the correct value of $\sigma_\mathrm{max}=\SI{3.12}{MPa}$ as indicated in \cite{OzboltBedeSharmaMayer:2015}, the internal length becomes \SI{73}{mm}, a size comparable to that of the specimen and which may undermine the approximation of brittle fracture via damage. Hopefully as the crack initiates at the center corner in presence of a stress singularity, the internal length should not influence much crack initiation, contrary to what is claimed in \cite{MesgarnejadBourdinKhonsari:2014}. The peak load as well as the global structural response is not sensible to the internal length, as can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig:alphav1500ell2x0F}. However with $\ell=\SI{2}{mm}$ the damage field obtained is slightly different from the case $\ell=\SI{1}{mm}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:v15ell1}, and crack nucleation from the foundation is also observed due to a smaller maximal tensile stress $\sigma_\mathrm{max}\approx \SI{19}{MPa}$ (yet still larger than the real value). Since in experiments no secondary crack initiation is present, we must ask the question how the critical stress $\sigma_\mathrm{max}=\SI{3.12}{MPa}$ is obtained in \cite{OzboltBedeSharmaMayer:2015}.
