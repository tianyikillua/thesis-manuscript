# PhD Thesis

This repository contains the LaTeX source files of my PhD thesis entitled "Gradient-Damage Modeling of Dynamic Brittle Fracture: Variational Principles and Numerical Simulations".

## PDF version

An author-generated PDF version is available at [http://thesis.litianyi.me](http://thesis.litianyi.me).

## LaTeX compilation

The simplest way is to use the `latexmk` script available in all latest TeXLive distributions. You only need to compile the main LaTeX file:

```
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

It should include all the chapter TeX files in the `chapters` folder and automatically call several times `pdflatex` and `biber` to obtain the final `main.pdf` file.
